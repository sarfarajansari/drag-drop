# Drag and Drop React App

This repository contains a React application where I implemented a drag-and-drop feature from scratch. The main functionality of the app allows users to drag items and drop them into a shipment container. It was an assignment given to me during my interview process at Settyl, and it helped me demonstrate my proficiency with React, state management, and handling user interactions in a dynamic way.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Users can visually drag items from a list and drop them into a shipment container. This feature is implemented without relying on external libraries, showcasing my ability to handle DOM manipulation and drag events in React.
  
- **Real-Time Updates**: As items are dragged, the shipment container dynamically updates to show the current contents of the shipment. The app instantly reflects changes, providing real-time feedback to the user.

- **Shipment Management**: Users can add multiple items to the shipment. The app provides an intuitive, user-friendly interface for managing the items and ensuring they are successfully loaded into the shipment.

- **Smooth UI/UX**: The drag-and-drop interactions are smooth and responsive, giving users a seamless experience while using the app.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: This project is built using React for creating the user interface and managing the app's state.
- **HTML/CSS**: Standard web technologies used for structuring and styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: Used for implementing the logic behind the drag-and-drop functionality, event handling, and state updates.

## Purpose

This project was created as part of an assignment during my interview at Settyl. It was designed to test my understanding of Reactâ€™s core features, including handling user inputs, updating state dynamically, and implementing interactive UI components. By building the drag-and-drop feature from scratch, I was able to demonstrate my problem-solving skills and attention to detail in creating an intuitive and functional web application.

## How It Works

1. The app displays a list of items that can be dragged.
2. Users can select an item and drag it over to the shipment box.
3. When an item is dropped into the shipment container, it is added to the list of items within the shipment.
4. The container dynamically updates to show the items that have been added, allowing users to track their shipment contents.
